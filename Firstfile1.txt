#Concept of alias
1. to use alias -- ex: alias ll="ls |wc-l"
2. to execute in a shell script use as exec `alias ll="ls |wc -l"`
3. to add the alias into bashrc file(perminent) use echo "alias ll='ls | wc -l' >> /etc/bashrc" , after executing the script then  run source /etc/bashrc to make effect of the added new command.
4. to remove alias use unalias <command>
